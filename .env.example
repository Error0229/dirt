# Environment configuration has been split by role:
#
#   .env.client.example  — Build-time config for desktop/mobile (safe to embed)
#   .env.server.example  — Server-side secrets for dirt-api (NEVER ship in clients)
#
# Quick start:
#   cp .env.client.example .env.client   # for building desktop/mobile
#   cp .env.server.example .env.server   # for running dirt-api locally
#
# This legacy .env file is still supported as a fallback but will be removed
# in a future release. Prefer the role-separated files above.
#
# See docs/DESIGN.md for the full configuration architecture.
